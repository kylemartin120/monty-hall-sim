This repository contains a simulation of the Monty Hall math problem. The
problem is as follows:

You are on a game show with three doors. Behind one of the doors is a car, and
behind the other two are goats. The goal is to open the door with the car,
thereby winning the car. You initially pick one of the doors. Then, the host
opens a second door, which has a goat behind it. You are then giving the option
of staying with the first door or switching to the third door (which was
neither picked by you or opened by the host). Should you switch doors?

This problem has been heavily debated within the math community. However, it
can be demonstrably shown through simulations that it is better to switch doors.
Switching leads to the car two out of every three times. The usual reason given
for this is that the game show host has more information, and has provided some
of that information based on the door he chose to open. In other words, since
the host knew which door the car was behind, and chose not to open that, he
provided additional information.

The goal of this simulation is to test whether that reasoning is accurate. To do
this, two types of simulations can be run: one in which the host knows which
door the car is behind, and one in which the host has no additional information,
and a door is chosen at random. In the simulation where the door is chosen at
random, there will be cases in which the door with the car is opened by the
host. Only the cases in which the randomly selected door reveals a goat will be
counted in the simulation statistics.

There are two files (besides this README) within the repository: a dot-c and
dot-h, both of which are named montyHall. The header file is used to declare
any helper functions, while the C file contains the function definitions and
main function.
